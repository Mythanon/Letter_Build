//I want to use it like this

//Keyboard.OnKeyDown (when key is actually down)
//Keyboard.OnKeyPress (when key is down and then up)
//Keyboard.OnKeyUp (when key is up)
//these functions will then do this
//Keyboard.OnKeyDown("Key code/char/blah blah blah", callback function)
//so lets just say
//Keyboard.OnKeyDown("Up", upPressed)
//Keyboard.OnKeyDown(upPressed)
//void upPressed(char key){
//if (key == "Up")
//}

//void upPressed(char[] modifers)	{
//if modifiers.shift = true
//Do something when Up is pressed...
